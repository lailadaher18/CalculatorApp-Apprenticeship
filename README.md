# CalculatorApp-Apprenticeship

I completed the main calculator logic first and then found a front end from https://github.com/pvicky4759/Calculator-project/tree/main
to use and used copilot to help me integrate the two.

I needed to adjust the controller to match some of my logic and the html scripts.

I used Copilot Agent to choose between a selection of testing frameworks I gave it to create a test suite for the calculator app.

It chose Selenium for the frontend testing that works well with Cucumber for the BDD style tests that are human-readable.
And it chose JUnit for the backend tests.

I adjusted the tests to match my logic and added some additional tests to make everything work together and run correctly in the limited time I had.
